      <p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 25px;">Written by Marion Veloria (27/12/18)</p>

      <p> This one is tough because I haven't been watching soccer for long.
          I started watching soccer in 2006 where I witnessed the world cup and
          the infamous Zidane headbutt, priceless. At that moment in time Ronaldo
          was a great young star but even then people still regarded Rooney as the brighter
          prospect. Now in hindsight we know who became the megastar but we didn't know
          that then.
      </p>

      <p> In my opinion I have Ronaldo at third all time only behind Messi
        and Pele (I have Pele 1 and Messi 2).  Now for me I ranked these players based on stats,
        accolades and worldwide recognition.  When it comes to stats and accolades Pele does have
        the edge on the two as he has 3 world cups; which the other two have none. It's a team game
        I know that but it's hard for me to ignore that since the world cup is so important, arguably
        the biggest competition in soccer. And clubwise all three have attained a fairly even amount
        of success. When it comes to stats Pele also has the upperhand as he reportedly has over a
        thousand club goals (some controvesy behind it but we will accept it). In terms of world recognition
        Pele hasn't played in a long time and is still one of the most recognisable faces in soccer and
        to me that says a lot. That's why I have Pele first.  I gave the slight edge to Messi because I
        feel as if he has a slightly larger effect in games with his ability to assist and create more goals.
        Not saying Ronaldo doesn't but Messi does it more (at this time December 2018, Messi has 264 club
        and country assist compared to Ronaldo's 215 assists; and messi did it in 152 games less than Ronaldo).
        Both also score at about the same rate so Messi's ability to facilitate gives him the edge for me.
      </p>

      <p class="article-margin"> Now just as a disclaimer this is my opinion and there are other
        players who I may not have even mentioned that could be in the top 3 discussion but for me
        these are my top 3.
      </p>
