      <p class="paragraph-font">
        Gronk was absolutely unstoppable in his prime arguably between 2011 to 2017. Watching him
        run through defenders and make absurd catches was always fun to watch. He was a clutch player
        as well often making big time catches in critical moments.  With all this offensive ability
        he was also a great run blocker, which most offensive TE are not in most cases. In his prime he
        was a physical freak of nature.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-font article-margin">
        However seeing him this year it's looking more likely that he is now past his prime.  I believe
        the injuries he's recieved through the years have finally taken their toll.  And because he was
        a player reliant on his athleticism his decline is even more evident.  Maybe I am wrong and he
        does well this upcoming playoffs and possibly even next season.  But one thing cannot be denied and
        that is his time as the best TE in the NFl is over.  The reason I have him as my GOAT TE is because
        he passes the eye test, where you can just see it he's just on another level to all the other TE.  Another
        reason is that he has the stats and championships to go along with it.  I didn't get to watch the other
        all time TE's because I only started watching football in 2008 so maybe I am a bit biased but for me
        Gronk is the GOAT TE.
