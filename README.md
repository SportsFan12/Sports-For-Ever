Title: Sports For Ever

Description: I love sports and regularly follow it through a website called bleacherreport.com.  Consequently I wanted to make my own version of the site using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4

Requirements: A web browser that supports Javascript will make time on the site more enjoyable.
